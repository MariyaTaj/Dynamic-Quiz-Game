**Dynamic Quiz Game**

This repository contains a concise Jupyter Notebook (`quiz_game.ipynb`) for a dynamic quiz game written in Python. Users are prompted to play the game and, upon agreement, they answer a series of questions. Their responses are evaluated against predefined answers, and a final score is provided at the end.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-quiz-game.git
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `quiz_game.ipynb`.

3. Run each cell in the notebook to play the game.

4. Answer each question and see your final score.

### Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x

### How it Works

1. Users decide if they want to play.

2. If agreed, questions are presented one by one.

3. Users provide answers, which are then evaluated.

4. Correct answers earn points.

5. After all questions, the final score is displayed.

### Customization

Customize questions and answers easily by modifying the `question_answer` dictionary in the notebook.

```python
question_answer = {
    "Question 1": "Answer 1",
    "Question 2": "Answer 2",
    # Add more as desired
}
```
